# Burger

This app allows the user to create and "eat" burgers using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM. The user can enter a burger into the text box and that burger will then appear in a list of available burgers. The user can then "eat" the burger which sends it into a list of "devoured burgers". Lastly, the burger can be fully deleted from the app.
